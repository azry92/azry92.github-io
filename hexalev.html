                <h1>Project</h1>
                <p>For my final year project, I was tasked to design a personal mobility vehicle for the next 20 years. I designed a personal aviation vehicle inspired by modern drones and innovative fire removal methods to create HexaLev.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Objectives</h1>
                <p>- Fires spreads at a rate of 30 seconds. Fires in these areas require a more organized collaboration between fire marshals and residents.</p>
                <p>- Incorporating fire rescue missions at a faster rate acting as first responders in high rise building fires.</p>
                <p>- Providing a safer way for first responders to enagage with hazardous smoke using alternative resources to eliminate fires.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h1>Concept</h1>
                <p>I drew my inspiration from companies such as Ehang and Volocopter GmbH where they specialize in manufacturing and developing personal air vehicles. I was also inspired by the Nissan Re-Leaf and Toyota E-Palette rescue vehicles. A six rotor drone kit is used as the design form for the drone as it provides the necessary stability to carry a pilot and the extinguisher launcher. A painting called the Flying Fireman from the series Visions of the Year 2000, 1899 by Jean Marc Côté helped to expand my imagination in creating HexaLev. The fire extinguisher ball is a modern product to extinguish fires safely. In combination with launching the ball using turbine energy concepts that utilises clean power to harness energy in the form of a launcher-cannon. A gyroscope is installed in the drone as a means of stabilization. The system uses a two person pilot, an air pilot and a ground pilot who controls the drone remotely in a fail-safe situation. To avoid large obstcles that give off electromagnetic waves such as a cell tower, the drone is installed with shielding to reduce the likelyhood of losing signals.</p>
